# Using Data Science to make predictions on Nfl Stats

Motivation: As an avid participant within fantasty football. I would like to predict which players to target for the upcoming season.
I would like to see which positions will likely generate the most points. Fantasty football uses a scoring system that uses numbers heavily.I hope to create a model will predict which players will likely accrue the most points in this upcoming season based on their stats the previous season.
