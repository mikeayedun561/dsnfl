# Using Data Science to make predictions on Nfl Stats

Motivation: As an avid participant within fantasty football. I would like to predict which players to target for the upcoming season.
I would like to see which positions will likely generate the most point. Fantasty football uses data heavily in fantasty points.
I hope to use my tools in Data Science to make findings.
